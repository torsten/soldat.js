# Soldat.js

We want to create a [Soldat](http://soldat.thd.vg/en/) like WebGl game. Any help is strongly appreciated.
This is currently version ZERO so don't expect clean code or something like that.

## Development

Compile CoffeeScript files to JavaScript.

    $ coffee -cj lib/soldat.js src/(^server).coffee
